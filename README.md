# Eye Diseases Classification and Detection

- CNN-based model meticulously designed to detect and classify eye diseases from intricate fundus images. Leveraging a sophisticated ensemble learning approach, this model combines the strengths of Inception V3, EfficientB3, and Resnet121 pretrained models, expertly fine-tuning and enhancing them with additional layers to extract more intricate features for precise classification. The crowning achievement lies in the incorporation of a weighted average ensemble learning technique, harmoniously merging these refined models to deliver unparalleled accuracy. Complementing this groundbreaking technology is a responsive Flask-based website, intuitively crafted to facilitate seamless user interaction and efficient diagnosis, ultimately revolutionizing eye disease detection and patient care.
